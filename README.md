# Tic Tac Toe
Hello there! I've always had a soft spot for the simple yet timeless game of Tic Tac Toe. It's one of those games that brings back fond memories of rainy afternoons, scribbling on notepads, and friendly competition. With an aim to recreate those nostalgic moments and introduce this classic to a new generation, I embarked on a journey to reimagine Tic Tac Toe using modern web technologies. Whether you're here for a quick game or just curious about my take on this beloved classic, I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it. Welcome to my version of Tic Tac Toe!

Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a timeless classic that pits two players against each other in a 3x3 grid. The goal is simple: be the first to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## How To Play

1. Starting: Launch the game script to see the Tic-Tac-Toe logo and rules.
2. Setting Up:
    * Choose your difficulty:
        * Easy: Computer moves randomly.
        * Medium: Computer plays to win.
        * Hard: Computer plays to win and blocks you.
3. Board & Moves:
    * The board is numbered 1-9.
    * Play as 'X'. The computer is 'O'.
    * Input a number (1-9) to place your mark.
4. Winning: Line up three 'X' in a row, column, or diagonal. If the computer aligns three 'O's first, it wins,
5. Ending:
    * Game outcomes: You win, the computer wins, or a draw.
    * After two games, choose to play again, adjust the difficulty, or exit.
6. Exit: When done, the game thanks you and exits.                 


## Features

### Existing Features

![Draw](docs/screenshots/Draw.png)


#### Computer Strategy

Computer's moves vary based on difficulty:

**Easy Mode ('e'):** In this mode, the computer doesn't strategize much. Instead, it simply makes random moves. The computer selects one of the available positions on the board at random and places its symbol there.

**Medium Mode ('m'):** The computer's primary onjective in this mode is to win. It scans the board for a potential winning move. If such a move exists, the computer will place its symbol in that position to win the game. If no winning move is identified, the computer will fall back to making a random move, just like in the easy mode.

**Hard Mode ('h'):** In this mode, the computer's strategy is twofold:
1. Winning Move: Initially, it looks for a move that allows it to win the game. If identified, it will execute that move.
2. Blocking Player: If no winning move is found, the computer checks if the player is about to win in the next move. If so, it places its symbol to block the player from achieving a three-in-a-row.
* If neither of the above conditions is met, the computer reverts to making a random move.

This strategy ensures that the computer becomes increasingly challenging to defeat as the difficulty level rises. In "Hard" mode, the computer not only plays to win but also actively tries to prevent the player from winning.


#### Replayability 

After a set of games, player can choose to continue, increase difficulty, or exit.

![Replayability](docs/screenshots/Replay.png)

#### Clear Console Interactivity

Provides a fresh view for each move by clearing the console, also if the user enters an incorrect or invalid command, the console will instantly clear itself, prompting the user to input the correct command without any lingering distractions. This design prioritizes user experience, ensuring that tasks are performed with ease and minimal interference.


### Future Features

1. Multiplayer Mode: A mode where players can face off against each other.
2. Enhanced AI: Considering the integration of the Minimax algorithm to make the AI opponent more strategic.
3. Username Integration: The option for players to set and use custom usernames might be introduced.
4. Increased Competition: Looking into ways to elevate the gameplay for a more challenging experience.

|Prompt to Play Again|At the end of a session|Game should ask if player wants to play again and handle both valid and invalid inputs|Works as expected|


### Python PEP8 Validation

Based on my mentor's recommendation, I installed Flake8 into my vscode. After addressing numerous issues, primarily extra spaces and excessively long lines, I was able to correct all the errors.

* pip install flake8

### Testing User Stories

#### User Story 1:

* As a casual player, I want a game that is easy to understand so I can start playing immediately.

    **Test:** Navigated to the game link and reviewed the welcome screen and instructions.

    **Result:** Instructions were clear and precise. The game was immediately understandable, and the welcome screen was intuitive

#### User Story 2:

* As a competitive player, I want the game to challenge me.

    **Test:** Played the game on different difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard).

    **Result:** The easy level was quite simple and suitable for a casual player. Medium posed a decent challenge. The hard level was notably more challenging, making it harder to win against the computer. This meets the requirements of a competitive player.

#### User Story 3:

* As a nostalgic gamer, I want the classic look and feel so I can reminisce about the old days.

    **Test:** Played the game and evaluated the design and gameplay elements.

    **Result** The game's interface and layout definitely provided a sense of nostalgia, especially the simple board design. The colored terminal display added a modern touch but still kept the classic feel intact.


### Development Bugs

Throughout the development process, each feature underwent manual testing. This led to the identification and resolution of several issues. As a result, all features are now functioning as outlined in the [features section](#features). A detailed account of the challenges faced during development is provided below.

1. **Intended Outcome:** Players expect the computer to block potential winning moves when its difficulty is set to 'hard'. 
    * ***Issue Found:***
        * The computer does not block the player's winning moves consistently when set to 'hard' difficulty.
    * ***Causes:***
        * The `make_move` function does not correctly act upon the result from the `find_blocking_move` method.
        * The order of checking winning moves for the computer and blocking moves for the player might cause the oversight
    * ***Solution Found***
        * I Modified the make_move function to prioritize checking for its own winning moves first (find_winning_move for 'O') only when on 'hard' difficulty, and then, if none are found, check for blocking moves to prevent the player from winning (find_blocking_move). 

2. **Intended Outcome:** After 2 games on 'easy' difficulty, the game should prompt the player to either increase difficulty or exit. If they choose to increase, the next games should be on the higher difficulty. 
    * ***Issue Found:***
        * After selecting to increase the difficulty, the next games do not reflect the increased difficulty.
    * ***Causes:***
        * The `computer` object, responsible for the computers's game strategy, isnt't being updated with the new difficulty setting even after the player's decision to increase it
    * ***Solution Found***
        * Initialization: When the difficulty is adjusted within the game loop, a fresh instantiation of the computer object is essential to reflect the new difficulty.
        * Implementation: After the player chooses to increase difficulty, the solution involves reinitializing the computer object with the new difficulty setting. This was done with the line: `computer = Computer(self.difficulty, self.check_winner)` 

3. **Intended Outcome:** After two games, when the player is prompted for a decision, the game screen should be cleared to provide a fresh view.
    * ***Issue Found:***
        * The game's console display remains cluttered with previous game information when prompting the user after two games.
    * ***Causes:***
        * There was no command to clear the console screen after the completion of two games and before prompting the user for their decision.
    * ***Solution Found***
        * Implementation of Clearing Mechanism: Integrate the clearConsole() function into the game loop, specifically before displaying the score and prompting the user after the two games.
        * Placement in Code: This was achieved by inserting the clearConsole() function call just before the score is displayed after two games are finished. By doing this, previous game data will be removed, presenting a clean slate to the user for their next action decision.               

4. **Intended Outcome:** Only the actual difficulty level input on the welcome screen should be displayed in cyan. After the first round, the "Difficulty Level" text should revert to white while the actual difficulty remains cyan. 
    * ***Issue Found:***
        * After the Welcome screen, both the "Difficulty Level" text and the actual difficulty are displayed in cyan. After the first round, the color for "Difficulty Level" switches back to default, but the intended behavior was for it never to be cyan in the first place.
    * ***Causes:***
        * The color setting from the Welcome screen's difficulty input is persisting beyond the input phase and affecting subsequent text displays in the game.
    * ***Solution Found***
        * Immediate Color Reset: Implement the Style.RESET_ALL command right after the difficulty input on the Welcome screen to prevent the cyan color from carrying over to subsequent text. This will ensure the color applied to the input does not affect other parts of the game.
        * This change will maintain the color of the actual difficulty in cyan while ensuring the "Difficulty Level" text remains in its default white color.
